**SDK Available: Python / NPM / REST API**

I built a cryptographic metering SDK. Here's what it does:

I'm not billing you. I'm preventing you from overpaying.

I meter usage at the server-side decision point (ALLOW vs DENY), and I export a signed reconciliation bundle you can audit and dispute with confidence.

I also provide post-quantum receipt signing (ML-DSA-65 / FIPS 204) so your governance evidence stays future-resistant.

**Available via evaluation license:**
- Python SDK
- NPM SDK
- REST API

DM me or email ABRAHAM@FINALBOSSTECH.COM for an eval key.

Include: org name, use case, deployment mode (cloud / on-prem / air-gapped).
