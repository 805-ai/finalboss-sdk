## Option A - Short (recommended)

```
FinalBoss SDK is now available under evaluation license.

I provide server-side metering at the ALLOW/DENY decision point + signed reconciliation bundles you can audit and use for disputes.

SDK availability: Python / NPM / REST API.

Access + overview: https://805-ai.github.io/finalboss-sdk/

Request an eval key: ABRAHAM@FINALBOSSTECH.COM

## Option B - Sponsor-style (CISO Series pattern)

```
Today's AI teams lack the granular control needed to prevent cost leakage and prove what was billed vs. denied.

I built FinalBoss SDK to meter at the decision point and export signed reconciliation bundles for audit and disputes.

Available (eval): Python SDK / NPM SDK / REST API

## Option C - Technical (engineers)

```
I'm releasing FinalBoss SDK (eval).

- Server-side metering at ALLOW/DENY (no client tampering)
- DENY tracked, not billed
- Signed, tamper-evident reconciliation bundle export
- PQC receipt signing (ML-DSA-65 / FIPS 204)

SDK: Python / NPM + REST API
